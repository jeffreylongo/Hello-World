    <p>
      Here I am going to write about the future of the history of web development.
      I found the article quite interesting as I began my development in HTML in the late 90's and early 2000's. 
      Javascript was new and extremely intimidating to me as it seemed much more like actual programming than HTML did. 
      This kind of pushed me towards things I could grasp easier such as Photoshop, DreamWeaver and Shockwave. 
      Since that time it seems that web development has grown by leaps and bounds and the technologies have become much more integrated. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that libraries have made creating complicated pages much easier and I believe the future will be even more immersive and inclusive. 
      I have not opened it in over a decade, but I would assume a program like DreamWeaver would be used in the future and everything will become a point and click interface.

      Biscuits is a flying squirrel I found on the floor. I'll put a picture up.
